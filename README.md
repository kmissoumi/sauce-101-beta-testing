```shell
repoURL="https://github.com/kmissoumi/sauce-101-beta-testing"
release="orange-0.0.1"

# clone repo
git clone ${repoURL} && cd sauce-101-beta-testing

# download my demo app
curl --get --location ${repoURL}/releases/download/${release}/my-demo-app.apk --output apps/my-demo-app.apk
curl --get --location ${repoURL}/releases/download/${release}/my-demo-app.ipa --output apps/my-demo-app.ipa

# set your access key
export TESTFAIRY_ACCESS_KEY=""

# off blast!
./buildEnv
```
